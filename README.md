# Pr0xima's Incomplete Systems Structure (P.I.S.S)

These are all just my own suggestions for building out a game systems structure that's fun to play. None of this is required, it's literally just a proposal, there's a million ways to structure a game and at the end of the day it's your baby.

# STATS

## Attack (ATK)
Real basic, your total ATK (without any other modifiers) gets added to the total Power variable in your score/damage calculation.

Notes:
Attack is simple but should be able to get slightly more complicated/powerful over a run with modifiers, but not as complicated as Magic and Mind builds should. My reasoning is that having an Attack build always be slightly simpler than the other stats is twofold:

 1.  It allows the player to have a very easy to understand mechanic to rely on during the initial learning phase when playing the game for the first time. Think Lemons/Cherries in CloverPit. Ol' Reliable, you know?
 2. It enables players to immerse themselves in the fun trope: *Big. Dumb. Ignorant. Muscle.* that is huge in DnD/Medieval Fantasy games.


## Magic (MAG)
Magic is tough for me to suggest a single effect, but I think it could (without modifiers) increase your special meter (I'd call it Mana at that point)

Magic, by its nature, is and always has been a really complex system for any game creator to assign and lock down to not end up broken. I think in this more engine-game context, making sure there are modifiers and abilities for players to *make it broken* later on in a run plays into the history of magic being busted as shit in games. But its gotta be earned.

## Mind (MND)
Mind should likely affect focus. It's the opposite of Big Dumb Muscle. I forsee this being an underrated build that hella players will treat like stone cards in balatro. Mind has middle child energy. Ensuring there's modifiers to implement a sorta unconventional, but still *really fucking powerful* build for this stat is a benefit to players that like to figure out crazy strats. 

## Prayer (PRY)
I think prayer should be your crit chance. I mean cmon, literally praying for RNG. It's perfect. Having modifiers that accompany the crit mechanic to add mult to DMG or other features would be huge. 

## Strength (STR)
Real simple. Number of hits.


# Character Classes/Archetypes
## Fighter
Big, burly, stupid meatmen that punch their way through a fight, puzzle, conversation, everything. Big hit. Barry Bonds. They should have a power ladder/tier structure. Think rungs in the army.
 
 **Brave Warrior**:
 Lowest pawn tier. Adds LVL to ATK, good infantry, needs leveling to be a big hit. Very dangerous in numbers. Lets players do a "horde" build where you just have like a billion pawns you can just keep throwing at an enemy even if they're doing real shit damage lol.

**Weaponsmith**:
Second Tier: +2 ATK for every 5 Levels, maybe add on +1 STR for every 10. Lets you focus on scaling your beefcakes for bigger hits, more times. 

**Crusader**:
Third Tier: +ATK by total level of all cards held in hand. SUPER powerful build if done correctly. I enjoy the idea of these guys being like famous super hero status in the world and the more bards fangirling over the crusaders (e.g. leveling everything up for them) the more powerful they get. 

**Commander**:
Highest Tier: +5 Base ATK. High in commmand, but with a cushy office job pushing people around. Hasn't fought in battle in like 10y but acts tough. They don't hit for shit, but they have the ability to "promote" the leftmost(or rightmost/whatever) fighter card up one rung in the tierlist. Warrior -> Weaponsmith | Weaponsmith -> Crusader | Crusader -> Commander. I enjoy the idea of balancing promotion or not accidentally over-promoting crusaders into commanders because you'll just have a bunch of shitty +5 ATK little bitches as a reward for your power greed.


## Monk
 **Mystic Monk**: (Suggest calling it Contemplative/Meditative Monk)
 Real basic, adds LVL to Mind. Currently meditating. Not very powerful or threatening when there's only 1-2 monks in play/your hand. 
 
 **Awokened Monk**: 
 Adds LVL to Mind AND multiplies it x5 for every additional Awokened Monk preceding it in the played hand calculation chain. Absolutely frightening and powerful when 5-6 Meditating/Mystic Monks are simultaneously awakened. When played, convert Awokened monk back to Mystic Monk.

These two monk cards require important modifier card(s) involved to be properly utilized. 
My suggestion is like "Incense" or "Meditation Circle" or something that awakens all monks in hand when played. 

## Demons
IDK YET FUCK


## Bards
 **Bard**:  Adds level to the guy to the left.
 Some kinda mirror functionality called like "Pirouette" to make bards affect the ones to the right instead. Get your bards all dancin in the rightwards direction and you've got turbo cumswapping
